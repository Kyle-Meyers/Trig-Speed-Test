# Trig speed test

This is an embeddable customizable trigonometry speed test game

Feel free to save or copy the `index.html` file to use it

TO DO: 
- Create a second sheet on the google sheet for just cos/sin/tan scores
- Automatically sort and remove duplicates from the Google Sheet with scores, make a leaderboard from it
- Make a "print" button to get a printable test with n problems
- Update question logic so that I don't use a different dictionary for every combination (more versatile)
